Mario Flores Vences
Programming Assignment 5 - Dungeon Adventure

Estimated time of assignment completion: ~20 to 25 hours

Extra credit implemented: 

- Added pits that generate in Rooms and damage player
- Added the Vision potion that reveals up to eight rooms that surrounds the player's
current room.

Shortcomings:

The game itself works. There are no errors that occur during gameplay. Balance of battling with
monsters could use improvements.

Questions:

I would like feedback on where I decided to handle the interactions between classes.
For example, the Room class handles the pit damage done to the Hero object and adds the
potion count to the Hero's inventory.
